# Essentials Plugin

A simple EssentialsX-like Paper plugin for the latest Paper version (1.21.4). This plugin is specifically made for my own network CraftNet.
The Benefits are that it doesn't any important vanilla mechanics and is very lightweight.

## Commands
- `/cc`
  - `reply` - Reply to the last message received.
  - `msg` - Send a private message to another player.
  - `tpask` - Sends a teleport request to another player.
  - `tpaccept` - Accepts a teleport request.
  - `tpadeny` - Denies a teleport request.
  - `tpacancel` - Cancels a teleport request.
  - `trash` - Opens a trash bin inventory.

All Commands can be accessed by the `/cc` command but might have an alias.
